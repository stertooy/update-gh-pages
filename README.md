# update-gh-pages

This GitHub action updates (or creates) the `gh-pages` branch of a GAP package using
[GitHubPagesForGAP](https://github.com/gap-system/GitHubPagesForGAP).

## Usage

The action `update-gh-pages` has to be called by the workflow of a GAP
package. By default, it will use the latest release of the package.

### Inputs

All of the following inputs are optional.

- `version`:
  - Set to a non-empty string to choose a specific release of your package (e.g. `v1.2.3`)
    instead of the latest release.
  - default: `''`
- `clean`:
  - Set to `false` to only update the information on the website and not the website code itself.
    This can be useful if you have made modifications to it.
  - default: `true`
